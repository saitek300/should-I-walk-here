# What Should I Watch Next?

## Description
What Should I Watch Next is an application that allows users to randomly generate movies or shows when they are conlficted on what to watch next. This will also display ratings as well as small descriptions of the movie or show. We used a combination of server side api's, Javascript, HTML, and CSS to achieve this.
